## Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to help companies to identify potential (high income) individuals for marketing campaigns as well as advertising.

<br />

### Methods Used
* Statistical Modeling
* Machine Learning Modeling
* Resampling

<br />

### Requirements
* Python 3.8.5
* Numpy 1.19.2
* pandas 1.1.3
* seaborn 0.11.0
* Matplotlib 3.3.2
* scikit-learn 0.24.2
* imbalanced-learn 0.8.08
* Streamlit 0.82.0
* etc.

<br />

### Project Overview
* The dataset requires little data cleaning and data formatting
* Data encoding and outliers handling are also needed
* EDA is then conducted for a thorough observation of the data
* Next, we do preprocessing for modelling part
* Lastly, we train the data by various models and measure their performances
